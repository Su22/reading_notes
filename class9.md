# SOP
An SOP is a procedure specific to your operation that describes the activities necessary to complete tasks in accordance with industry regulations, provincial laws or even just your own standards for running your business. Any document that is a “how to” falls into the category of procedures

## Why Are SOPs So Important? 
SOPs specify job steps that help standardize products and, therefore, quality. To ensure that processes continue uninterrupted and are completed on a prescribed schedule. By following SOPs, you assist in avoiding process shut-downs caused by equipment failure or other facility damage

## Challenges in Writing SOPs
One of the most significant challenges in writing SOPs is that there are no hard and fast rules for writing them. A format or writing style that works for one organization may not work as well with another organization. Secondly, SOPs can become out of date very quickly if not regularly maintained.
