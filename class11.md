# SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

* Download a program from a selection of existing free software options designed to monitor SSD health by tracking operating temperature and performance metrics
* When investing in a new SSD, buy strategically. Many SSDs come equipped with S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) that warns users of potential failure and prompts them to take preventative measures.
* Have a backup strategy. Backup data regularly and routinely, even if your SSD was purchased recently and appears to be in good health. Unexpected corruption, power surges, viruses, or physical harm could befall your drive and cause permanent data loss. You truly never know what could happenâ€”which is why valuable data should always be duplicated somewhere secure.
## How do you fix a failed SSD
* Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system.
* Power cycling the SSD.
* Idling in the boot menu.
* Updating SSD firmware
* Updating drivers
