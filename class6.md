# Windows Defender Security Center in Windows 10

Your computer's primary line of defense against malware and viruses is the Windows Defender Security Center.

Once you install third-party antivirus software, the Center becomes secondary. Many antivirus features become inactive, but you can monitor your device's security from the Center's dashboard. Other security settings, such as those related to Microsoft Edge, parental controls, and your Microsoft account's protection, can also be adjusted from within the Center.
